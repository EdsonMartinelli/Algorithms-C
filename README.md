# Algorithms in C

Some algorithms built with C standard library, without assistance of third-party libraries.

## What is needed to run?

You gonna need the GCC compiler to run with my bash scripts, otherwise you can use the C/C++ compiler of your preference and create your own builder script. 

## How to run?

To run with the builder scripts present in each folder go to the folder and run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

## Algorithms

- *Linked List* : Doubly Linked List with methods to get, pop and push items.
- *HeapSort* : Sort algorithm using heap structure.
- *Priority Queue* : Ensures the first item of array have the higher weight/importance. It have methods to add and extract.
- *HashMap* : Simple hashmap implemented with linked list to add a tuple with key and value and get the value based on key.
